# Humpback-Whale-Recognition-

I implemented this project in 2018 at machine learning internship program. I have recently added a number of my public projects to my github.

The program used one shot learning on images of whale tails to detect whether the whale was one of the previously observed whales or not. In case the whale was detected as one of the previously seen whales it identifies which whale it is.
